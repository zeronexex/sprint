# Why
Say you have a file with 50k CNAMES and for some reason you want to split those CNAMES in smaller chunks. Sprint takes the count of the chunk, it creates files and writes those CNAMES chunks in files accordingly.

# Installation
You have to have Go installed in your machine

`go get github.com/zeronexex/sprint`

# Update

`go get -u github.com/zeronexex/sprint`

# Usage 

`splityet -h`
